        'description' => 'Basil, Ocimum basilicum, is a member of the Lamiaceaefamily (the mint family) and is closely related to lavender, marjoram, oregano, thyme and spearmint. There are numerous varieties of basil and in this country the most commonly used basil is referred to as “sweet basil” which is typically grown in Mediterranean countries. The name “sweet basil” is a bit misleading, as Thai basil has much more of a sweet quality.' . "\r\n" . "Sweet basil is the type found in Italian dishes, is most commonly used fresh and typically is added towards the end of the cooking process, as cooking quickly dissipates the herb's distinctive flavor." . "\r\n" . "Sweet basil has .5% to 1.1% essential oil, primarily linalool (40%) and methyl chavicol (25%). The strong clove scent of sweet basil is derived from eugenol which is the same chemical found in the spice cloves. In addition, soil, climate and time of harvest will impact not only the amount, but also the composition of the essential oil of that particular harvest." . "\r\n" . "Basil is called habaq, reehan (Arabic), yu xiang ca (Mandarin), basilie/basilic commun (French), basilikum (German), barbar (Hindi), bajiru (Japanese), manjericao (Portuguese), bazilik (Russian) and albahaca, alfabega (Spanish). Is also referred to as herb royale and great basil."

        'description' => 'Spearmint and peppermint are the leaves of perennial herbs which are used fresh or dried. When dried these herbs retain much flavor produce a strong taste. Mint leaves have a pure and pleasant aroma. The flavor profile of spearmint is refreshing and mellow with a delightfully pungent taste and undertones of lemon.' . "\r\n" . 'Dried Spearmint Leaves are also known as dried mint. If your recipe calls for mint (without specifically calling for Spearmint or Peppermint) this is most likely what it means. Peppermint is most often used in baking, making candy and in chocolate sauces, where it is infused into alcohol, water or oil before using. Spearmint is milder than Peppermint and can be tolerated by even the most sensitive palate.' . "\r\n" . 'Dried mint is best used to compliment bolder flavors such as rubs, that are heavy on chiles and pepper, or hearty root vegetables. Spearmint also works well with fruit, meats, other herbs and is a key ingredient in many yogurt sauces. Dried mint is probably best known as a key ingredient in Middle Eastern Tabouli,  the Greek Meatball dish Keftedes as well as in the Turkish Cacik, which is a cucumber and yogurt salad. Spearmint also adds a delightful zest to casseroles, vegetable stews, lentils, salad, cooked vegetables and noodle and bean soups.'
